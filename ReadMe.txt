This project is a Java Swing application, which simulates Monopoly game. 
My experience in creating Swing applications is minimal and therefore the application 
may not be perfectly built GUI application, but the goal is to make 
the engine right, so playing the game will be the same as playing physical game and 
this is the priority. 
The concept of the game is owned by Hasbro. 
I am not willing to gain any financial benefit of this game. 
Anybody can reuse the code in this repository, just give me the credits, if you do:
